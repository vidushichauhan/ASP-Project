### Project Overview
- **Course**: COMP-8567
- **Title**: Distributed File System
- **Due Date**: August 13, 2024, 11 PM EDT
- **Marks**: 100
- **Plagiarism Detection Tool**: MOSS

### Project Requirements
- The project can be done individually or in teams of two (students from the same section).
- The project involves implementing a distributed file system with three servers (`Smain`, `Spdf`, and `Stext`) and multiple client connections.
- The clients interact only with `Smain`, which handles and forwards requests to the other two servers as needed.

### Servers and Their Roles
- **Smain**: Handles client requests, stores `.c` files locally, forwards `.pdf` files to `Spdf`, and `.txt` files to `Stext`.
- **Spdf**: Stores `.pdf` files.
- **Stext**: Stores `.txt` files.

### Client Commands
1. **ufile filename destination_path**: Uploads a file from the client's working directory to `Smain`. 
   - Example: `client24s$ ufile sample.txt ~smain/folder1/folder2`
2. **dfile filename**: Downloads a file from `Smain` to the client's working directory.
   - Example: `client24s$ dfile ~smain/folder1/folder2/sample.txt`
3. **rmfile filename**: Deletes a file from `Smain`.
   - Example: `client24s$ rmfile ~smain/folder1/folder2/sample.pdf`
4. **dtar filetype**: Creates and downloads a tar file of the specified file type from `Smain`.
   - Example: `client24s$ dtar .pdf`
5. **display pathname**: Displays a consolidated list of `.c`, `.pdf`, and `.txt` files in the specified directory.
   - Example: `client24s$ display ~smain/folder1/folder2`

### Project Files for Submission
- **Smain.c**: Main server code.
- **Spdf.c**: PDF server code.
- **Stext.c**: Text server code.
- **client24s.c**: Client code.

### Notes
- All servers and clients must run on different machines/terminals and communicate via sockets.
- The system must handle errors appropriately and include comments explaining the code's functionality.
- Demonstration and viva will be scheduled post-submission.
